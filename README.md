# DND_Class_Selection
Android application to practice ListView.

Users may select a Dungeons & Dragons class from a scrollable list. An image above automatically changes to a picture relating to the choice. The user may change the rating of the listed D&D classes using stars (a RatingBar). The list is dynamically populated using ListViews following two formats. Images used are not my own.
